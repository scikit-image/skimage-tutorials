    "# Image analysis in Python with SciPy and scikit-image\n",
    "\n",
    "Across domains, modalities, and scales of exploration, images form an integral subset of scientific measurements. Despite a deep appeal to human intuition, gaining understanding of image content remains challenging, and often relies on heuristics. Even so, the wealth of knowledge contained inside of images cannot be understated. <a href=\"http://scikit-image.org\">Scikit-image</a> is an image processing library, built on top of <a href=\"http://scipy.org\">SciPy</a>, that provides researchers, practitioners, and educators access to a strong foundation upon which to build algorithms and applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Image analysis is central to a boggling number of scientific endeavors. Google needs it for their self-driving cars and to match satellite imagery and mapping data. Neuroscientists need it to understand the brain. NASA needs it to [map asteroids](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-26528516) and save the human race. It is, however, a relatively underdeveloped area of scientific computing. Attendees will leave this tutorial confident of their ability to extract information from their images in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial is aimed at intermediate users of scientific Python with a *working knowledge of NumPy*.  We introduce the library and give practical, real-world examples of applications. Throughout, attendees are given the opportunity to learn through hands-on exercises.\n",
