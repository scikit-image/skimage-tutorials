    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "Across domains, modalities, and scales of exploration, images form an integral subset of scientific measurements. Despite a deep appeal to human intuition, gaining understanding of image content remains challenging; yet the wealth of knowledge contained inside of images cannot be overstated.\n",
    "\n",
    "`scikit-image` is a collection of image processing algorithms for the Scientific Python (SciPy) ecosystem. It has a Pythonic API, is well documented, and aims to provide researchers and practitioners with well-tested, fundamental building blocks for rapidly constructing sophisticated image processing pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this training, we give an interactive overview of the library, and let participants try their hand at various educational image processing challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attendees are expected to have a working knowledge of NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Presenter Bio\n",
    "\n",
    "Stéfan van der Walt is a researcher at the Berkeley Institute for Data Science, UC Berkeley. He has been a part of the scientific Python developer community since 2006, and is the founder of scikit-image. Outside of work, he enjoys running, music, the great outdoors, and being a dad.\n",
