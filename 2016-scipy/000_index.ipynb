    "# Image analysis in Python with SciPy and scikit-image\n",
    "\n",
    "From telescopes to satellite cameras to electron microscopes, scientists are producing more images than they can manually inspect. This tutorial will introduce automated image analysis using the \"images as numpy arrays\" abstraction, run through various fundamental image analysis operations (filters, morphology, segmentation), and finally complete one or two more advanced real-world examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Image analysis is central to a boggling number of scientific endeavors. Google needs it for their self-driving cars and to match satellite imagery and mapping data. Neuroscientists need it to understand the brain. NASA needs it to [map asteroids](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-26528516) and save the human race. It is, however, a relatively underdeveloped area of scientific computing. Attendees will leave this tutorial confident of their ability to extract information from their images in Python.\n",
